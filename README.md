## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)


In my family, we are involved in renting apartments, and the idea occurred to me:
why not make the reservation process and management easier?
That's when I started this project. Its goal is to enable prospective guests to quickly and easily find and book accommodation for themselves.
The accommodation provider also has the opportunity to analyze the data and manage the reservations
